# Simple image classifier
This is a simple image classifier that has been trained to teel the difference between photos of clmbing walls and photos of brick walls. It was created to learn how to create a basic machine learning model using fastai then deploy it using gradio and hugging face spaces. This was done as part of lesson two of the Practical Deep Learning for Coders course.
