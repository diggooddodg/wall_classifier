# Simple image classifier
This is a simple image classifier that has been trained to tell the difference between photos of clmbing walls and photos of brick walls. It was created to learn how to create a basic machine learning model using fastai then deploy it using gradio and hugging face spaces. This was done as part of lesson two of the [Practical Deep Learning for Coders course](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson2.html).
